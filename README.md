<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Remember the time you bought a picnic blanket for your club's outing that's now sitting in the back of your closet? Or when you had to get a vacuum cleaner that was only used once at the start of the semester? We tend to make purchases that we later regret, because we don't end up using them often. This is especially true when we're only in an area for a short period of time, or when we face money or storage space constraints. Case in point: college students, who have a limited budget, who face the pain of moving once every year, and who have minuscule dorm rooms that can only fit a limited selection of their most important belongings.

RentDash addresses this common problem by offering users the opportunity to borrow items on a one-off basis from neighbors, rather than invest fully in purchasing the item for themselves. On our platform, lenders will be able to post items they would like to rent out, while renters can search through existing offerings or post new item requests if none exist. Lenders can set monetary rental rates based on their time unit of choice (hour, day, week, etc.). But to incentivize community sharing free of charge, RentDash will also allow lenders to choose alternative compensation in the form of in-platform credits called "karma" that they can then apply to their own rentals in the future. Once a rental is confirmed online, RentDash will also provide a built-in private communication channel for the lender and renter to coordinate item pick-up and return, streamlining the rental process end-to-end. And finally, to ensure the reputability of everyone on RentDash, both lender and renter will be able to rate and leave reviews on the other.

Unlike traditional consumer-to-consumer e-commerce platforms, our service specifically targets college students looking to acquire short term rentals within their campus area. Our goal is to provide a smooth experience for renters who might not want to go through the hassle of buying and reselling items that they only plan to use for a limited time duration, or who might need an item very urgently and wish to avoid lengthy delivery times. This means providing users with the flexibility to select from a range of different time periods including the hour, day, week, or month. Because of this, we also place a special focus on facilitating rentals of smaller goods as opposed to larger goods like appliances, cars, and apartments. Unlike e-commerce platforms that are integrated with social media accounts, building a centralized platform with the sole focus on facilitating on-campus transactions adds a layer of privacy and separation that eliminates the need for social media presence. Our karma and rating systems work in tandem to ensure that all transactions conducted are safe and secure. This, combined with our emphasis on close proximity between students located within the same campus area also eliminates the need for coordinating shipping and charging shipping fees, and allows for more efficient, more reliable, and more effective rentals.
